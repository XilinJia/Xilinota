**unless a directory contains a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file**, in which case that
file applies to the code in that sub-directory.

For example, packages/server contains a LICENSE.md file, thus all code under the
packages/server directory is licensed under that license.

For example, packages/app-cli does NOT contain a LICENSE file, thus all code
under that directory is licensed under the default license, which is
AGPL-3.0-or-later.
