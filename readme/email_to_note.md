# Email to Note

You can save your emails in Joplin Cloud by forwarding your emails to your Joplin Cloud email address. The subject of the email will become the note title, and the email body will become the note content. The note will be created inside a notebook called Inbox.

All notes created this way will use, like any other note, your Joplin Cloud storage capacity.

This feature is available for Pro and Teams members.
