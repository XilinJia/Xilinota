# Development mode

When experimenting with Xilinota, for example when [developing a plugin](https://github.com/XilinJia/Xilinota/blob/dev/readme/api/get_started/plugins.md) or trying a theme, you might want to run Xilinota in development mode. Doing this will open a second copy of Xilinota using a different profile with test notes and notebooks, so you can experiment without risking changing or deleting your data.

To enable Development Mode, go to **Help > Copy dev mode command to clipboard**. This will copy a command to your clipboard. Paste this command in a shell / terminal to run a development version of the app.
