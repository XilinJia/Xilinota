At first, Joplin stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, at the time a 13-year-old boy but later one of Joplin's students and a rag-time composer in his own right.[26] There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until 1904, as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician.</p>

He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band, and his own six-piece dance orchestra.</p>
