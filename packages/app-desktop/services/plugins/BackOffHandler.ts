// This handler performs two checks:
//
// 1. If the plugin makes many API calls one after the other, a delay is going
//    to be applied before responding. The delay is set using backOffIntervals_.
//    When a plugin needs to be throttled that way a warning is displayed so
//    that the author gets an opportunity to fix it.
//
// 2. If the plugin makes many simultaneous calls, the handler throws an
//    exception to stop the plugin. In that case the plugin will be broken, but
//    most plugins will not get this error anyway because call are usually made
//    in sequence. It might reveal a bug though - for example if the plugin
//    makes a call every 1 second, but does not wait for the response (or assume
//    the response will come in less than one second). In that case, the back
//    off intervals combined with the incorrect code will make the plugin fail.

export default class BackOffHandler {

	// The current logic is:
	//
	// - Up to 1000 calls per 10 seconds without restrictions
	// - For calls 1000 to 2000, a 100 ms wait time is applied
	// - Over 2000 calls, a 200 ms wait time is applied
	// - After 10 seconds without making any call, the limits are reset (back to
	//   0 second between calls).
	//
	// If more than 5000 simultaneous calls are being throttled, it's a bug in
	// the plugin (not waiting for API responses), so we stop responding and
	// throw an error.
